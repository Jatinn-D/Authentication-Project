 **ABOUT THIS PROJECT**

 This project is a secure authentication system built using Django. It includes essential authentication features with a strong focus on security and user experience. The key features of this authentication system are:

>>> **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, change passwords, and log out securely.

>>> **Email-Based Password Reset:** Users receive a password reset link via email, which expires in 10 minutes for enhanced security.

>>> **Restricted Access:** Users cannot access the home page without logging in or creating an account.

>>> **Login Required After Signup:** New users must log in again after signing up before accessing the home page.

>>> **Email Verification for Password Reset:** Users can only reset their password using the same email linked to their account, preventing unauthorized resets.

This authentication system is designed to ensure a secure and seamless user experience while protecting user credentials and access.
